## Surveillance System for Medical Assistance

This project aims for monitoring environments for any 
abnormal incidents. This goal is achieved using a machine learning model 
which uses the CNN algorithm. It classifies unusual incidents such as Bike_accident, 
Car_accident, Dog_bite, and Faint.An alert is generated through if abnormal incident is detected.

The static model of the project is made where the user manually gives input video 
of CCTV footage to detect any unusual incident. From the given input video, frames 
are extracted which are fed into the model to classify all the images. The majority 
classification is taken as an overall result for the video.
